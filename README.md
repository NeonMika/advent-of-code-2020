# advent-of-code-2020
 
This year, I want to try to solve all problems in two languages I do not feel fluent yet: Python and Prolog.

I want to become more producitve and efficient when writing in Python, so this seems like a nice challenge.

For Prolog: Yeah... I have no idea. :D I always liked logic programming, took a course at university a few years ago, and did not touch Prolog since then. Let's see how long I will last. :D
